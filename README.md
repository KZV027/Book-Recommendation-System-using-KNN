# Book Recommendation System using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository implements a book recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system leverages the FreeCodeCamp book dataset to recommend books to users based on their past preferences.

**Features:**

* Utilizes the KNN algorithm to identify similar books based on user ratings.
* Recommends books based on user-provided ratings or existing user data.
* Offers a flexible approach for customizing the recommendation process.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* NumPy library (`pip install numpy`)
* Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

**Getting Started:**

1. **Download the Dataset:**

   ```bash
   wget https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/books/book-crossings.zip
   ```

2. **Unzip the downloaded file:**

   ```bash
   unzip book-crossings.zip
   ```

3. **Run the script:**

   Modify the script (`BookRecommedation.ipynb`) to specify the path to the unzipped dataset and other parameters (e.g., number of neighbors). Then, execute the script:

   ```bash
   BookRecommedation.ipynb
   ```

**Dataset:**

This project utilizes the FreeCodeCamp book dataset, which contains user ratings for various books. The dataset is included in the downloaded `book-crossings.zip` file.

**How it Works:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The script loads the book ratings data from the CSV file.
   - It preprocesses the data to ensure it's suitable for KNN analysis.

2. **KNN Implementation:**
   - The KNN algorithm is implemented to identify the `k` closest neighbors (most similar books) for a given user based on their ratings.

3. **Recommendation Generation:**
   - Recommendations are generated by analyzing the ratings of the nearest neighbors. The system suggests books that similar users have enjoyed.

**Customization:**

* You can modify the script to:
    - Adjust the number of neighbors (`k`) used for recommendations.
    - Explore different distance metrics for calculating similarity between books.
    - Integrate the recommendation system into a web application or user interface.

**Further Development:**

* Implement a user interface for collecting user ratings and displaying recommendations.
* Explore additional recommendation techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.
* Evaluate the performance of the KNN model and compare it with other algorithms.
  
**Note:**
This is a basic implementation of a book recommendation system using KNN.
